# 🚀 Journey: The Future of Generative AI WebUI

## 🌌 Introduction

With the rise of generative AI models and rapidly evolving methodologies, there's a pressing need for a cutting-edge webUI. **Journey** steps in to offer a fresh yet familiar interface for creating and modifying images, and to provide a seamless platform to implement and test pipelines swiftly.

## 🎛 Core Features

- **Independence**: While Journey's core isn't tied to specific systems like Diffusers or StabilityAI, our initial release leans on functions from the former.
- **StabilityAI Integration**: In our upcoming updates, expect enhanced integration with StabilityAI's generative models for improved model loading and sampling capabilities.
- **Intuitive UI**: Features a user-friendly UI with prompt, model selection, basic generation options, and an image uploader for varied functionalities like In/Outpaint and Image2Image generations.
- **Blocks**: Introducing the concept of "Blocks" in WebUI, which are akin to nodes but follow a linear design. This means no convoluted graphs, ensuring a visually pleasing and straightforward experience when building pipelines.
